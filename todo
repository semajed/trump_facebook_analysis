Things to do:

Box plots for each reaction - done
Sentiment Analysis - doneish
Cluster words together - done
implement ggplot2 for prettier visualizations - low priority
Look at posts with highest reactions, the outliers
Exponential instead of linear?



Possible re-parse the data to get rid of punctuation but leave spaces where they were

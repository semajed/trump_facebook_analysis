Things to do:

implement ggplot2 for prettier visualizations - low priority
Look at posts with highest reactions, the outliers
Exponential instead of linear?



Possible re-parse the data to get rid of punctuation but leave spaces where they were

    - Compare # of reactions with bar plots
    - Standard Deviation differences
    - Time series
      - Splitting the data based on time
- Answering the questions
  - How did Trump's Facebook activity change after he announced his presidential candidacy?
      - (time series)
      - (linear regression of responses)
  - What were his most popular topics of interest?
      - (word cloud)
        - (word cloud of most liked posts)
